# Secret Code Char Translator — Mobile App

**Secret Code Char Translator** is a mobile application built with React Native and TypeScript that allows users to translate text between multiple classical ciphers. Users can both encode and decode text and learn about each cipher inside the app.

## App Overview
The user can enter any text and select one of five supported ciphers:

- **Atbash**
- **Morse Code**
- **Caesar Cipher**
- **ROT12**
- **Numeric Substitution Cipher**

The app supports both directions:
- Plain text ➜ Encoded text
- Encoded text ➜ Decoded text

Each cipher also includes a short informational screen explaining how it works.

## Development & Assets

- Written in **TypeScript**
- Published on the **Google Play Store**
- Custom UI assets created using Pixlr

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** React Native
- **Language:** TypeScript
